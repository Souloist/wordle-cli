# wordle-cli
Simple command line version of popular game Wordle as an excuse to learn Go

## Installation 

To run this app:
```
go run .
```
or you can build the binary and run it
```
go build
./wordle-cli
```

## How to play

__WARNING__: This game does clear the terminal 

When you execute the app, you'll be asked to make a guess.
- characters which are contained in the answer will be highlighted yellow
- characters that share an exact index and value will be highlighted in green
- characters that do not exist in the answer will be highlighted in grey

After 6 guesses, if you cannot guess the answer, you lose!

Can't win them all :(



## Future Improvements

- Add a keyboard visual after each guess to keep track of letters which were either contained in the answer, had the correct index or were not part of the answer
- Improve the guess display to use colored background tiles instead of
- Add a flag to ask the user if the game should clear the terminal after guesses (felt like a better game UX but maybe not the best idea)
